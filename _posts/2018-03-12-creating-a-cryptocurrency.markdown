My interest in Cryptocurrencies has increased massively over the past few months. Blockchain truly is a revolutionary technology. It is such a fascinating concept that I decided to delve a little deeper and try to create my own Cryptocurrency. Although it won't be revolutionary like Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin was, it will help me truly understand the technology that powers it.

Since this idea came to me during a very boring night, I decided to name my Cryptocurrency the Boredcoin. It will be based on an old fork of Litecoin, and
I will be discussing all of the specifics behind the coin at a later blog post. 

For now, you can keep up to date on the Boredcoin at my blog, as well as the below links.

Cheers!
